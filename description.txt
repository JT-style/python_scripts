Description
I want to create a script that will help me to study new english words.
Create_folder - ask me the name of the folder and create the folder with this name.
Translate script - open some folder and check all inner folders and files in it> then create the list with names of each file.
I am going to create some script that will include the both scripts.

I will be create a list with the unknown words.
IT will be
	1 .open that list and take the first value
	2. create the folder called as a word
	2. open openphrase website enter this word and download a single video.
	4. open common folder with all this files and create a list with names of these files.
	3. when it will be done, create a dict with keys and values and create an exel file with this dictionary.
		keys- the english phrases(list that i created in the past)
		values - translation of each phrase

Now i have only script that created the folders. I download videos by myself. Also a iave a  script that create a dict with keys and values and create an exel file with this dictionary.
i will write this script later. Definately!
